# 🍽️ Task 1 - Predict Restaurant Ratings  
**Machine Learning Internship - Cognifyz Technologies**

## 📌 Task Objective  
To develop a machine learning model that predicts the **aggregate rating of a restaurant** based on various features.

---

## 🔧 Key Steps

- ✅ **Data Preprocessing**
  - Handled missing values
  - Encoded categorical variables
  - Performed train-test split

- ✅ **Model Implementation**
  - Started with **Linear Regression** and **Decision Tree Regressor**
  - Improved results using **Random Forest** and **XGBoost**

- ✅ **Model Evaluation**
  - Evaluated models using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R² Score**

- ✅ **Feature Importance**
  - Analyzed key features impacting restaurant ratings
